// Template Literals 
/* 

Template literals simplify string interpolation and multiline text formatting. 
By using backticks (`___` ), you can embed expressions into strings with ${}. 
This makes concatenating variables and expressions with text easy, eliminating the need for cumbersome string concatenation.
