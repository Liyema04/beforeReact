Covering key JS concepts for beginners.

## contextOfRefresher
    I have found two resources with relatively positive engagement, from [Youtube @PedroTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m55PTVUrlnA&list=PLKd2jrxxKUdSWGscjd4TWXFNy8VnyirQU&index=3&t=137s)  and a rather detailed [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-refresher-for-react-beginners/?ref=dailydev#heading-1-template-literals) by Nildri S. Jyoti.

    The article is more comprehensive ,than the YtTutorial, whilst they both cover the same topics.It offers a list of fifteen crucial JavaScript topics that beginners must familiarize themselves with before starting their [React](https://react.dev/) journey. Apart from the long list of topics, Nildri mentions expansive learning of modern JS. e.g. [ES6+](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/introduction-to-es6/), which you will have to tackle if you are revisiting the language or are a beginner (like myself). 

### Why I should care?
    Most beginners think that they need to know the whole of JavaScript, beacause React is built on-top of the language. However,    
    regardless of your expierience-level as a developer, brushing-up on theses JS concepts will help you build a solid foundation. In a library that has become an industry standard.
